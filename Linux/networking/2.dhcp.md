Let’s dive into DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and its setup on a Linux system.

---

### 1. What is DHCP?

DHCP is a protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and network configuration (e.g., subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices in a network.

Instead of manually configuring each device, a DHCP server automates this process.

A DHCP server maintains a pool of IP addresses and assigns them to clients when they request an IP.

### 2. Installing and Configuring a DHCP Server on Linux

#### Step 1: Install the DHCP server

For most Linux distributions, you can use the package manager to install the DHCP server.

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
```

For Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install dhcp-server
```

#### Step 2: Configure the DHCP server

The main configuration file for DHCP is usually located at `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`.

1. Edit the DHCP configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

2. Add a subnet configuration: Replace the example below with your network details.

```bash
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200; # IP range for clients
    option routers 192.168.1.1;       # Default gateway
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4; # DNS servers
    option domain-name "example.com"; # Domain name
}
```

3. Enable logging (optional): Add the following line to track client leases:

```bash
log-facility local7;
```

4. Save and exit.

#### Step 3: Configure the DHCP service

1. Ensure the DHCP service is set to listen on the correct network interface. Edit the file:

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
```

Set the interface, e.g.:

```bash
INTERFACESv4="eth0"
```

For Red Hat/CentOS: Configure `/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd`:

```bash
DHCPDARGS="eth0";
```

2. Restart the DHCP server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```

3. Enable it at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server
```

### 3. Managing Leases and Reservations

#### View Active Leases

Leases are stored in a file, typically located at `/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases`. To view them:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
```

It shows which IP addresses have been assigned to which devices.

#### Add a Reservation

Reservations allow you to assign a specific IP address to a specific device (identified by its MAC address).

1. Edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` and add a host entry:

```bash
host mydevice {
    hardware ethernet 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E; # MAC address of the device
    fixed-address 192.168.1.50;          # Reserved IP address
}
```

2. Save and restart the DHCP server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```

---

### 4. Testing the DHCP Server

1. Verify DHCP Server is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
```

2. Test from a client machine: Configure the client machine to use DHCP (not a static IP). Once it requests an IP, check the server’s lease file (`/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases`) to confirm the assignment.

---

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Check Logs: 
DHCP logs can be found in `/var/log/syslog` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/var/log/messages` (Red Hat).

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

#### Common Issues:

- **No IP assigned?**
  - Check if the server is running.
  - Verify the interface configuration (`INTERFACESv4`).
  - Ensure there’s no IP conflict.

- **Clients not connecting?**
  - Ensure the network switch/router allows DHCP traffic (UDP ports 67 and 68).
