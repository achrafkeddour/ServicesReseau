Let's explore Routing on Linux, focusing on static routes and dynamic routing protocols using tools such as Quagga and FRRouting.

---

### 1. Routing Basics

Routing is the process of forwarding packets between networks. In Linux, this is handled by the kernel's routing table.

---

### 2. Static Routes

#### 2.1: What are Static Routes?

Static routes are manually configured routes that specify how to reach a particular network. They remain fixed and do not adapt dynamically, making them suitable for small, predictable networks.

---

#### 2.2: Adding Static Routes

1. **View the current routing table:**

   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```

2. **Add a static route:** Use the `ip route add` command:

   ```bash
   sudo ip route add <destination_network> via <gateway_ip> dev <interface>
   ```

   **Example:**

   To route traffic to `192.168.2.0/24` via gateway `192.168.1.1` on `eth0`:

   ```bash
   sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
   ```

3. **Verify the route:**

   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```

4. **Delete a static route:**

   ```bash
   sudo ip route del <destination_network> via <gateway_ip>
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   sudo ip route del 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
   ```

5. **Make routes persistent:**

   Add the route to the network configuration file:

   - **Debian/Ubuntu:** Edit `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/netplan/*.yaml` depending on your setup.
   - **Red Hat/CentOS:** Edit `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>`.

---

### 3. Dynamic Routing Protocols

Dynamic routing enables routers to exchange information and automatically adjust routes based on network changes. Tools like Quagga and FRRouting implement dynamic routing protocols.

---

#### 3.1: Installing Quagga or FRRouting

1. **Quagga (deprecated, but still used):**

   - **Debian/Ubuntu:**

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install quagga quagga-doc
     ```

   - **Red Hat/CentOS:**

     ```bash
     sudo dnf install quagga
     ```

2. **FRRouting (modern replacement for Quagga):**

   Install FRRouting from your distributionâ€™s repositories or compile it from source:

   - **Debian/Ubuntu:**

     ```bash
     sudo apt install frr frr-doc
     ```

   - **Red Hat/CentOS:**

     ```bash
     sudo dnf install frr
     ```

---

#### 3.2: Configuring Dynamic Routing Protocols

Dynamic routing protocols include RIP, OSPF, and BGP. We'll configure an example using OSPF.

---

**Example: Configuring OSPF with FRRouting**

1. **Enable FRRouting:** Enable and start the FRRouting service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable frr
   sudo systemctl start frr
   ```

2. **Configure FRRouting:**

   Edit `/etc/frr/daemons` to enable the desired protocols. For OSPF:

   ```bash
   ospfd=yes
   ```

   Restart FRRouting:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart frr
   ```

3. **Edit OSPF Configuration:**

   Open the OSPF configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo vtysh
   ```

   Enter OSPF configuration mode:

   ```bash
   configure terminal
   router ospf
   network 192.168.1.0/24 area 0
   exit
   exit
   ```

   Save the configuration:

   ```bash
   write
   ```

4. **Verify OSPF is running:**

   ```bash
   show ip ospf neighbor
   ```

---

#### 3.3: Configuring RIP with Quagga

1. **Enable RIP in Quagga:**

   Edit `/etc/quagga/daemons` and enable RIP:

   ```bash
   ripd=yes
   ```

   Restart Quagga:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart quagga
   ```

2. **Edit RIP Configuration:**

   Edit `/etc/quagga/ripd.conf`:

   ```bash
   router rip
   network 192.168.1.0/24
   network 10.0.0.0/8
   redistribute connected
   ```

   Save and restart:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart quagga
   ```

3. **Verify RIP is running:**

   ```bash
   telnet localhost ripd
   show ip rip
   ```

---

### 4. Logs and Troubleshooting

**Static Routes:**

- Use `ip route` to verify routing table entries.
- Use `ping` and `traceroute` to test connectivity.

**Dynamic Routing:**

- Check logs:

  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```

- Verify protocol-specific settings in FRRouting or Quagga.
